# COVID-19 Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of COVID-19 tests using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized for training and evaluation can be found [here](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20220625).

## Model Performance

The model has demonstrated a commendable accuracy rate of **91.26%** on the given task.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation and Initialization**: This step involves the construction of the dataset and preprocessing of the raw data to make it suitable for training.

2. **Constructing the Neural Network**: The neural network architecture is designed and implemented to effectively capture patterns in the data.

3. **Model Training**: The constructed neural network is trained using the prepared dataset to optimize its parameters and achieve the desired predictive performance.

For further details on the implementation and usage of the model, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Dawson-ma/Covid-19_Prediction/blob/main/Covid19_Predict.ipynb) provided.
